### The camera uses computer vision and tries to determine if the person in the room is asleep or in pain if they are in pain the camera will then send a notification

### The video feed is proccessed and then disgarded immidiately, this will save resources and speed up the process. It will also stop anyone from being able to view the video feed; this keeps the users private areas safe from being viewed while still having the camera working there
